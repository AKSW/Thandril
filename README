### Using Thandril ###

Once your Server is running all you need to do is open your browser pointing to the host/port you just published and play with the dashboard at your wish. I hope that you have a lot of fun with this application and that it serves it's purpose of making your life easier.

### Environment ###

Thandril was built with a variety of Frameworks and is mainly written in Scala, HTML, JS and CSS. The Webserver itself was built with the [Scala Play-Framework](//www.playframework.com/). The Website was built mainl with [Twitter Bootstrap](://getbootstrap.com/), [JQuery](://jquery.com/) and [FontAwesome](//fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)

### Compilation/Running the Server  ###

All you have to do is to install the [Typesafe Acticator](//www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/Installing) and subsequent execute the following commands:

- activator update
- activator run

If you wanna package the Application and deploy it to some kind of Server-System, please have a look at the [Activator documentation](//typesafe.com/activator/docs).
